# How to set up Virtual Linux
This is not a Dotfiles repo in it's purest form (like my [dotfiles-macos](https://github.com/asjafjell/dotfiles-macos) repo). The purpose of this setup is to be able to use Intellij IDEA in an `Citrix Workspace` with vaguely similary keyboard setup in order to code. This works where the hardware is a mac with a physical Norwegian keyboard, American English as layout and the virtual device is Ubuntu 22.04.

## Guide

1. Add keyboard layout `English (US, intl., with dead keys)` on Ubuntu.
2. In the Preferences of Citrix Workspace (![image](https://github.com/asjafjell/dotfiles/assets/720545/9b45085d-017e-47a5-8fe0-dca3aeab4c0c)),
   choose the double arrows in the right corner, `Keyboard` and set the following:
   
   ![image](https://github.com/asjafjell/dotfiles/assets/720545/3312a09c-4a06-4ab0-8d0a-4dc22b01823a).
   
   This will map 
   - Right ⌘ button to `Meta`, which we can map in Intellij IDEA.
   - _Left Option + Left ⌘_ to `Option`     
3. Map `Windows` key to `Meta`. This is a bit backwards, but it does the trick for giving us a key which can act as a Command key (⌘). In Intellij IDEA, do the following:
  - _Help -> Edit Custom Properties_,
  - Add `keymap.windows.as.meta=true` to the file.
5. Install the plugin [macOS Keymap](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13258-macos-keymap). This plugin adds keymap called _Intellij IDEA Classic (macOS)_ as a keymap. This will have a lot of shortcuts where `Meta` is used.
6. We must remove a few default shortcuts from Ubuntu in order to use them in Intellij. Remove with the following script:
   ```shell
   # To find other settings, please install app Dconf-Redigering. Most settings are found within 
   # org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings some within /org/gnome/mutter/
   # Choosing a shortcut, right click and copy gives a setting like the one under here. Emptying the
   # array removes all shortcuts for that functionality
   
   # Remove shorcuts for Activities:
   gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock hot-keys false
   for i in $(seq 1 9); do gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-${i} '[]'; done

   # Remove Show Programs and Run Command:
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings panel-main-menu "[]" # Disable Alt + F1
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings panel-run-dialog "[]" # Disable Alt + F2
   
   # Remove showe/hide desktop (cmd + D) - enables duplicating lines
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings show-desktop "[]"
   ``` 
   Then manually set the following with the app Dconf-Edit (Dconf-Redigering):
   ```shell
   gsettings set org.gnome.mutter.keybindings toggle-tiled-left []
   gsettings set org.gnome.mutter.keybindings toggle-tiled-right []
   ```

7. [Install Frame switcher](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7138-frame-switcher) which enables hot swapping between multiple instances of Intellij IDEA. Enables opening recent projects and open projects by search.
8. _Right click-menu_ keybinding. Add the following shortcut in _Settings -> Keymap_ -> `Show Context Menu`: `Meta + Shift + 0`. 
9. Search for _Go to_, set following
   - `Go to class`: `Ctrl + O`
   - `Go to class`: `Ctrl + Shift + O`
10. Search for _Move statement_, set following
   - `Move statement up`: `Ctrl + Shift + Up`
   - `Move statement down`: `Ctrl + Shift + Down`
11. Disable shortcuts for apps/mission control `Ctrl + Up` and `Ctrl + Down` on the Mac hostto enable next/previous method:
   - System settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Mission Control
   - Untick `Mission Control` and `Application Windows`

## Summary of nifty shortcuts after configuration
- `Start/end of line`: `fn + Left / Right` or `Cmd + Left / Right`
- `Page up/down`: `fn + Up / Down`
- `Selection for next occurence, Select/unselect`: `Ctrl + G / Ctrl + Shift + G`
- `Method, Next/Previous`: `Ctrl + Up/Down`
- `Move method up/down`: `Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down`
- `Error, Next/Previous`:`F2 / Shift + F2`
- `Selection, Increase/Decrease`: `Cmd + W / Cmd + Shift + W`
